# Smart_Grain_Dryer
We had designed a smart grain
dryer based on the principle of Equilibrium moisture content which states that a
transfer of moisture takes place from higher moisture content area to lower
moisture content area by means of diffusion till they reach a equilibrium
moisture content. In general, higher airflow rates, higher air temperatures and
lower relative humidities increase drying speed. Raising the temperature of the
dry air increases the moisture-carrying capacity of the air and decreases the
relative humidity. As a general thumb rule, increasing the air temperature by 20
degrees Fahrenheit (F) doubles the moisture-holding capacity of air and cuts
the relative humidity in half. The rate of moisture movement from high moisture
grain to low relative humidity air is rapid. However, the moisture movement
from wet grain to moist air may be very small or nonexistent.
